Pod::PP        adpO  A POD pre-processor                          RAM

The Pod::PP module is an instance of Pod::Parser that adds pre-processing
support to POD.  It is not run automatically by POD tools: an explicit
podpp pass is required.

The podpp command-line interface is similar to cpp:

	podpp -DDIR=/tmp -Ih -I../h file.pp > file.pod

The supported directives are the classical cpp directives (if, ifdef,
define, etc...), plus the following additional ones:

	=pp require "file"
	=pp image <center> "file.png"

The `require' directive includes a file *once*, and `image' lets you
introduce pictures in your pod2html translations.

I mostly wrote Pod::PP to add the `image' directive, so that I could
write a nice online HTML documentation in POD for a big Intranet application
I developped.  As the documentation grew, I felt the need for the other
cpp-like features, so I added them.

My thanks go to Brad Appleton, who wrote Pod::Parser, thereby making Pod::PP
quite easy to write.
